== 2020-09-15 v1.2.0

=== Added

* Functionality added to the NodePing API on https://nodeping.com/docs-api-changes.html[2020-09-14]
	** New function `NodePing.Checks.get_many` and `NodePing.Checks.get_many!`
	** Uptime functionality added to all the `NodePing.Checks` get functions
	** offset opt added to `NodePing.Results.get_results`
	** Added events function `NodePing.Results.get_events`
* Added module docs to the checktypes in `NodePing.Checktypes`

=== Fixed

* Some of the get functions in `NodePing.Checks` wouldn't return a tuple like one might expect with `:ok` or `:error`. This was fixed and the proper ! identifier functions were added.
* `NodePing.Helpers.merge_querystrings` ignores `nil` values
